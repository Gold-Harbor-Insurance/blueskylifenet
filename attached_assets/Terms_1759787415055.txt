What We Do
The Site enables insurance agents, insurance companies, carriers, and other similar parties who are customers of the Site (each a "Service Provider") to offer for sale and to sell, insurance and other products to you. Once you provide us with the information required on our form, we attempt to match you with appropriate insurance agents, brokers, carriers or other service providers to help you acquire the type of insurance you are seeking. We do not issue insurance contracts or bind coverage. We are not responsible for, nor do we assume any financial or other liability whatsoever, for the conduct of any Service Provider. We are not an insurance agent or insurance carrier, and we do not issue insurance contracts or bind coverage ourselves, nor do we endorse or recommend any companies or specific types of insurance policies. While we publish content on the Site about insurance, we do not provide insurance, tax or financial advice of any kind. We do not guarantee that any Service Providers to whom we forward your application will contact you or agree to provide you coverage. We are not responsible in any way for the conduct of our Service Providers that are matched with your insurance application. The coverage provided by any Service Provider will be subject the terms and conditions of the insurance policy under which it issued, and we have no control over such terms and conditions.
