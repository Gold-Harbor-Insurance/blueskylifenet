Customer Information Parameters
The customer information parameters are a set of user identifiers you share alongside your event information. For more information about required and recommended parameters, see Best Practices - Conversions API: Send Required and Recommended Parameters.

In the Graph API v13.0 release there were new requirements around the combinations of customer information parameters that are considered valid. Please review the best practices to ensure your Conversions API integrations are not interrupted.

Please visit the Meta Privacy and Data Use Guide to learn what data is sent when using the Conversions API.

Our systems are designed to not accept customer information that is unhashed Contact Information, unless noted below. Contact Information is information that personally identifies individuals, such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers, that we use for matching purposes only. If you are using the Meta Business SDK, the hashing is done automatically.

Pixel Comparison
You can send many of the customer information parameters through the Meta Pixel, though some (for example, client_user_agent) are sent automatically as part of how the internet works. For example, to send external_id through the Pixel, use the following code:

fbq('init', 'PIXEL_ID', {'external_id': 12345});
Read about the other parameters you can pass with Pixel in the Advanced Matching documentation.

Vice versa, make sure to apply the same set of customer information parameters your system is currently sharing to the browser side to the server side.

Formatting the user_data Parameters
You must provide at least one of the following user_data parameters with the correct formatting in your request.

external_id
External ID

string or list<string>
Hashing recommended.
Any unique ID from the advertiser, such as loyalty membership IDs, user IDs, and external cookie IDs. You can send one or more external IDs for a given event.
If an External ID is being sent via other channels, it should be in the same format as when sent via the Conversions API.

client_ip_address
Client IP Address

string
Do not hash.
The IP address of the browser corresponding to the event must be a valid IPV4 or IPV6 address. IPV6 is preferable over IPV4 for IPV6-enabled users. The client_ip_address user data parameter must never be hashed.
No spaces should be included. Always provide the real IP address to ensure accurate event reporting.
Note: This information is automatically added to events sent through the browser, but it must be manually configured for events sent through the server.

Example:
IPV4: 168.212.226.204
IPV6: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

The user agent for the browser corresponding to the event. The client_user_agent is required for website events shared using the Conversions API.

Sending both the client_ip_address and client_user_agent parameters for all of the events you’re sending through the Conversions API may help improve event matching and could also help improve ad delivery for any ad campaigns optimizing on the events you send through the Conversions API.
Note: This information is automatically added to events sent through the browser, but must be manually configured for events sent through the server.

Example:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)
